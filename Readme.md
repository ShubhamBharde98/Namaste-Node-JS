# Namaste Node JS

## Pre-requisites:-
- Download & install node js
- Any code editor

## Checking node & npm version:-
- ```node --version ```
- ```npm --version```

## Run js program outside the browser using node js environment:-
- ```node <file name>.js ```

## What is Node js?
- Node js it is js runtime environment, which allow us to execute js code outside of the Browser or anywhere. 

- Node JS is built on top of Chrome's V8 js engine.

- ```FunFact ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚:-``` Actually Node JS is C++ program / application with V8 embedded into it.

- It is written in C++ language.

- It is developed by "Ryan Dahl" in the year of 2009.

- It has an Event Driven Architecture which capable of Non Blocking/Asynchronous I/O. NodeJS has event queue & event loop.

- It is maintained by OpenJS Foundation.

- NodeJS is neither language nor a framework.


## JS on Server
- Earlier js primilarly run on only browser.

- now using node js runtime environment, you can run js code outside the browser or anywhere or on server.


## Server:-
#### "A server is a computer or software that continuously listens for client requests, processes them using algorithms or computations, and sends back responses."

A server can refer to hardware, software, or both, depending on the context:-
1. Hardware (Physical Machine):- A powerful computer designed to run server applications (e.g., a data center server).

1. Software (Server Application):- A program that listens for and processes client requests (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Node.js server).

1. Remote or Local Machine:-
    - A server can be remote (cloud-based, like AWS EC2).
   
    - It can also be local (your own computer acting as a server for testing).

1. Virtual Servers:- Cloud providers use virtualization to run multiple virtual servers on a single physical machine (e.g., AWS, Docker containers).


Server operates on the client-server architecture, where clients make requests, and the server responds.

It is designed to be highly available (24/7), reliable, and scalable, making it more robust than a personal computer. Servers allow us to deploy applications, files, and services, ensuring seamless access over a network."


### Types of Servers: 
1. Web servers (Apache, Nginx)
1. Application servers
1. Database servers (MongoDB, MySQL)
1. File servers
